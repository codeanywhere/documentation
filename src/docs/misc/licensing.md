# Licensing Informations

Our user's privacy is of utmost importance to us.  Here you will find information about how your repls are licensed.

## Public Repls and Classrooms

Content published to a public repl or a Classroom are automatically published under an MIT license.  The full text of the MIT license reads as follows:

> Copyright <YEAR> <COPYRIGHT HOLDER> <URL TO REPL>

> Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

> THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

We do not take down content from public repls unless it is in violation of our Terms and Conditions.  Please be careful of what you add to anonymous repls, as they cannot be deleted!

## Private Repls and Classrooms

Content published to a private repl and private classrooms are unlicensed and therefore still belongs to you, provided it does not violate our [Terms and Conditions](https://repl.it/site/terms).  If you would like to attach your own license to the code, we recommend you include the license as a (code) comment as part of the repl.
