![favorite languages dropdown](/images/misc/favorite-languages-dropdown.png)

Your favorite languages are a combination of the top 3 languages you selected as interested in and and the ones you use most often. You can update the languages you're interested in by by visiting [repl.it/~/cli/account/languages?run=1](https://repl.it/~/cli/account/languages?run=1)

If you do not pick at least three languages the remaining amount will be automatically chosen at random for you.

Example: You decide to only choose two languages we will end up choosing a third for you.
