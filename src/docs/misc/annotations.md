# Annotations

Annotations enable you to have conversations over code, within repl.it

> We're still in the process of rolling out annotations. If you don't see them yet, you may need to enable [explorer mode](/misc/explorer)

#### Different ways to use annotations

Code Annotations make it easy for collaborators to point to particular areas of code, ask questions about syntax, and question decisions during code reviews. Here are some example workflows:

- While collaborating with users, you can use annotations to discuss a selection of code synchronously.

- You can leave annotations for your collaborators to address when they return to the repl. This is really useful if you're teaching a class of students, and want to leave personal feedback on their code.

- You can leave annotations as a way to highlight and call attention to a selection of code.

#### Using annotations

- Once you're in a repl, you can create annotations by selecting some code, and clicking the annotation button above the editor.
	
	> You can also create annotations via right-clicking and selecting annotate, or using the keyboard shortcuts Cmd+Shift+/ (or Ctrl+Shift+/)

- Add your message, and hit enter!

- Other collaborators will see your message, and can reply to it.

- Once you're done with an annotation, you can delete it.

#### Mentions

You can mention someone by typing `@<their username>`. This is a great way to grab their attention outside a repl.

This is especially useful when three or more collaborators are working in a repl simultaneously.

#### Linking files

You can link files by typing a `#` followed by a file path. This lets your collaborators jump to a file immediately. 

Or you could simply drag a file into an annotation, which automatically sends the file link as a message.

#### Troubleshooting

If you're unable to create annotations,

- Make sure you have write access to the repl.
	- Are you signed into the right account?
	- If it's someone else's repl, have they invited you to it?
- Have you enabled explorer mode?
