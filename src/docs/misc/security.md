## Reporting a vulnerability

Being a small startup with limited resources we unfortunately can't run a bug bounty program. However,
if you report a vulnerability responsibly then we'll work with you to fix the issue and then we will
credit you on our blog.

## Responsible Disclosure

Pursuant to our [terms of service](https://repl.it/site/terms), you should not take any actions
that interferes or disrupts the service. When in doubt, and think there might be a risk of service
disruption, then don't try to verify the bug yourself -- email us and we'll work with you to verify
it.

Email us at [security@repl.it](mailto:security@repl.it) with a description of the issue and we'll
try to respond as soon as possible.
