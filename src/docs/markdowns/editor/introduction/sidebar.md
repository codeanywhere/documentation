# Sidebar

The new Codeanywhere IDE introduces a sidebar which contains the following productivity widgets:

- [**File Explorer**](#file-explorer)
- [**Search**](#search)
- [**Source Control**](#source-control)
- [**Debug**](#debug)

### <a name="file-explorer" href="#file-explorer" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>File Explorer

The File Explorer is used to browse, open, and manage all of the files and folders in your project. You can do many things from the File Explorer widget:

- Create, delete, and rename files and folders.
- Move files and folders with drag and drop.
- Use the context menu to explore all options.

#### <a name="uploading-files" href="#uploading-files" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>Uploading Files

You can <code>drag and drop</code> files from your computer into the File Explorer to upload them to your project.

### <a name="source-control" href="#source-control" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>Source Control

Codeanywhere has integrated source control management and includes Git support by default. The Source Control widget can be very useful for users who use their containers for working on their remote git repositories.

The Source Control icon will always indicate an overview of how many changes you currently have in your repository.

Selecting the icon will show you the details of your current repository changes:

- CHANGES
- STAGED CHANGES
- MERGE CHANGES

There are several useful buttons in the Source Control widget header:

- **1**: Toggle between <code>Tree view</code> and <code>List view</code> of your repository changes
- **2**: Commit your changes
- **3**: Refresh the Source Control widget
- **4**: Add a <code>Signed-off-by</code> trailer at the end of the commit message
- **5**: Menu with the most common git commands

You can use the Extensions widget to browse and install extensions from the marketplace. Find more information [here](/editor/extensions/install-extensions-from-marketplace).
