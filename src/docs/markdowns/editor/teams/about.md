# What are Codeanywhere Teams?

Team up with up to more than 200 users to create a shared workspace for programming. You can manage all accounts and remove a user at any time. Code changes are visible in real-time, you can even share the terminal. 

Special rates for schools apply - check with support. 

"What kind of apps will you make?" 

This is the question that drives everyone here at CodeAnywhere! 
We believe that anyone has the potential to create amazing things, whether they are just starting out or looking to collaborate with others. 
That's why we built CodeAnywhere as a platform that allows anyone (even beginners!) to build web applications with our smart solution
