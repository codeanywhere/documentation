# About

Collaboration is just a way of saying "let's work together". When you share an editing session with someone else,
you will be able to write code in parallel in real-time without ever having to worry about merging the changes.

Our collaboration includes capabilities for:
  - Reading and writing documents
  - Real-time chat
  - Collaborative terminals
  - **No limits on the number of concurrent users**
