# Share Container with Others

First, you have to open the IDE for the container with the project you want to collaborate on.

After you enter your workspace, you will notice a <code>Collaborate</code> option in the navigation bar.

By clicking on it, you will open a window which displays your current collaborators and prompts you to invite new collaborators.

You can interact with your collaborators via chat in the <code>Collaboration</code> tab available in the right sidebar. Also, collaborators have a shared terminal at their disposal.

**Note**: You have to create at least one container to collaborate with friends. Don't know how to create a container? Learn [here](/dashboard/containers/create-new-container).
