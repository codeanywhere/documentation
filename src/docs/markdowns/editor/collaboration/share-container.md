# Share Container with Others

A collaboration session can be started by clicking the <code>Collaborate</code> button in the IDE. The users you invite will get an invitation link via email.

First, you have to open the IDE for the container with the project you want to collaborate on.

After you enter your workspace, you will notice a <code>Collaborate</code> option in the navigation bar.

By clicking on it, you will open a window which displays your current collaborators and prompts you to invite new collaborators.

You can interact with your collaborators via chat in the <code>Collaboration</code> tab available in the right sidebar. Also, collaborators have an unlimited number of [shared terminals](/editor/collaboration/collaboration-terminals) at their disposal.

**Note**: You have to create at least one container to collaborate with friends. Don't know how to create a container? Learn [here](/dashboard/containers/create-new-container).
