### <a name="what-is-a-container"  href="#what-is-a-container" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>What is a container?

<code>Containers</code> are like your own Virtual Private Servers (in essence they are OpenVZ OS containers) provisioned by Codeanywhere, each one with its own amount of RAM, disk space and processing power.

Containers give you the ability to provision any development environment you like. You can choose between one of the many [predefined templates](/general/getting-started/faq#which-template-to-select-which-programming-language-will-i-use-the-most) which Codeanywhere offers.

Learn how to create a container [here](/dashboard/containers/create-new-container).

### <a name="which-programming-language-can-i-use-in-the-container"  href="#which-programming-language-can-i-use-in-the-container" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>Which programming language can I use in the container?

Codeanywhere offers support for a wide range of programming languages in the shape of the following predefined templates:

- **PHP**
- **NodeJS** – JavaScript
- **Ruby**
- **Python**
- **C/C++**
- **Wordpress** – PHP
- **Java**
- **.NET Core** – C#
- **Go** 
- **Rust** 

If you wish to use a different programming language, you can do so by [creating a container](/dashboard/containers/create-new-container) with a <code>Blank</code> template, and installing the necessary dependencies in the container terminal.

### <a name="can-i-install-extensions-from-the-vs-code-marketplace" href="#can-i-install-extensions-from-the-vs-code-marketplace" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>Can I install extensions from the VS Code marketplace?

Find out [here](/editor/extensions/install-extensions-from-marketplace) how to install extensions from the marketplace.

### <a name="how-can-i-connect-my-container-to-a-ftp-connection" href="#how-can-i-connect-my-container-to-a-ftp-connection" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>How can I connect my container to a FTP connection?

Connecting your existing FTP connection to a container is pretty straight-forward. [Open the IDE](/editor/introduction/how-to-access) for any of your created containers and navigate to the <code>Connections</code> widget in the [sidebar](/editor/introduction/sidebar/#connections).

If you have already [created an FTP extension](/dashboard/connections/create-new-connection), you will now be able to interact with it in the IDE.

### <a name="how-can-i-use-my-github-repository-in-a-container" href="#how-can-i-use-my-github-repository-in-a-container" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>How can I use my Github repository in a container?

### <a name="how-can-i-connect-to-my-container-via-ssh-e-g-putty" href="#how-can-i-connect-to-my-container-via-ssh-e-g-putty" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>How can I connect to my container via SSH (e.g. Putty)?

You can connect to all of your containers via SSH. You can find the <code>host</code> and <code>port</code> of your container by navigating to <code>Help -> Getting Started</code>.

<p><img src="/images/general/getting-started/ssh-connection-params.png" alt="SSH connection parameters" class="width-90"/></p>

**Note:** The username for the SSH connection is always <code>cabox</code>

For the above container, you would connect via SSH by entering the following command in the terminal:

```bash
  ssh cabox@host30.codeanyhost.com -p 42293
```

**Note:** You have to [authorize your private key](/general/getting-started/faq#authorize-key-for-ssh-container) to enable the SSH connection.

### <a name="how-can-i-authorize-my-computer-to-connect-via-ssh-to-my-container" href="#how-can-i-authorize-my-computer-to-connect-via-ssh-to-my-container" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>How can I authorize my computer to connect via SSH to my container?

To authorize yourself to access your container, you will have to add your public key to the
<code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file.

To generate a key pair enter the following command into your terminal and select the destination where you want the keys to be generated:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa
```

Once the keys have been generated, copy the <code>id_rsa.pub</code> (If you chose a different name for the keys, make sure you select the one with the <code>.pub</code> extension).

Paste the key inside of the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file inside your container.

```bash
  vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

(<code>:wq</code> to close and save when you're done).

After you start your server application, click on the <code>Open Browser</code> button when it shows up at the bottom of your screen. If you close the widget, you can always find your public port in the [Preview ports widget](/editor/#preview-ports).

<p><img src="/images/general/getting-started/postman-1.png" alt="Preview server app" class="width-90"/></p>

You can find the public link for your API in the new tab which will open in your browser window.

```
https://port-3000-my-app-fabjanv.codeanyapp.com/
```

You can use that link as the base URL for your API and send specific requests to it using the [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) platform.

### <a name="if-i-press-the-tab-key-the-last-word-is-automatically-repeated-how-can-i-fix-it" href="#if-i-press-the-tab-key-the-last-word-is-automatically-repeated-how-can-i-fix-it" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>If I press the tab key, the last word is automatically repeated. How can I fix it?

In mobile devices the keyboard default configuration has autocomplete functions activated. You need to disable predictive text, automatic replacement, and automatic spell check and it will work fine without duplicated text.
