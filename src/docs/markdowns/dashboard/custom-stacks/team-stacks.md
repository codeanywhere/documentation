# Team stacks

Codeanywhere Teams can share stacks between each other. This allows your team members to create copies of your containers making it ideal
for teams with complex configurations and projects.

Team stacks are created automatically when [creating a custom stack](/dashboard/custom-stacks/create-new-stack).

Additionally you can access your team stacks easier if you apply the `Team` filter.
