# Create New Stack

If you wish to use a custom development environment from one of your containers in your future projects, Codeanywhere offers you the ability to create a custom stack. [Create a container](/dashboard/containers/create-new-container) using a [predefined stack](/general/getting-started/which-stack-to-select) and install all the desired software.

To create a custom stack, navigate to the <code>Custom stacks</code> tab in the sidebar and click the <code>Create Stack</code> button.

After a new window shows up, you will be asked to provide the name and description for your new custom stack and select the existing container whose configuration you want to mirror.
