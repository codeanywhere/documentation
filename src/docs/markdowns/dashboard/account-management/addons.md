If you want to purchase addons, you have to [change your subscription](/dashboard/account-management/update-subscription) and purchase new addons.

You can choose between the following addons:

- **Additional Container** - Additional Containers give you the freedom to work with multiple workspaces inside Codeanywhere
- **Always-On Option** - Regular containers will be stopped when you sign out. Containers with the applied “Always-On” option will keep running even if you’re not working. Perfect for hosting applications right from your container.
- **Additional 15 Custom Domains** - Custom Domains enable you to add any domain you wish to our containers (for example: example.domain.com).
- **Additional 15 Connections** - Connect to remote environments via SSH, FTP, FTPS or SFTP.
