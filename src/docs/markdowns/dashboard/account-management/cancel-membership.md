# Cancel Membership

If you want to initiate the cancellation process of your membership, click the <code>Cancel my membership</code> at the bottom of the <code>Account</code> page and follow the instructions.

**Note**: If your refund period has expired, it makes more sense to keep your membership until its expiration date.
