# Working with Repositories

With Codeanywhere, youâ€™ll be able to work directly with your repositories. You can work with your repository using standard git commands inside your SSH terminal. Go to the [Connections](/editor/sidebar/connections) widget in the sidebar and right click on your container and select SSH Terminal in order to open it up.

### <a name="saving-changes" href="#saving-changes" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>Saving Changes

Stage all changes in a file for next commit:

```sh
git add <filename>
```

Stage all changes in a folder for next commit:

```sh
git add <foldername>
```

Add all files to staging:

```sh
git add *
```

Commit changes to head:

```sh
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

Commit all changes in the working directory:

```sh
git commit -a
```

### <a name="inspecting-a-repository" href="#inspecting-a-repository" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>Inspecting a Repository

List which files are staged, unstaged, and untracked:

```sh
git status
```

Display the entire commit history using the default formatting:

```sh

```

### <a name="connecting-to-a-remote-repository" href="#connecting" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>Connecting to a Remote Repository

Add the server to be able to push to it:

```sh
git remote add origin <server>
```

List all currently configured remote repositories:

```sh
git remote -v
```

### <a name="working-with-branches" href="#working-with-branches" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>Working with Branches

Create a new branch and switch to it:

```sh
git checkout -b <branchname>
```

Switch from one branch to another:

```sh
git checkout <branchname>
```

List all the branches in your repo, and also tell you what branch you're currently in:

```sh
git branch
```

Delete the feature branch:

```sh
git branch -d <branchname>
```

Push the branch to your remote repository, so others can use it:

```sh
git push origin <branchname>
```

Push all branches to your remote repository:

```sh
git push --all origin
```

Delete a branch on your remote repository:

```sh
git push origin :<branchname>
```

For example, if you want to push to your master branch, just use:

```sh
git push origin master
```

### <a name="update-the-remote-repository" href="#update-the-remote-repository" class="anchor-link"><img src="/images/anchor.svg" alt="Link anchor" class="anchor-img"></a>Update the Remote Repository

Merge changes on the remote server to your Container:

```sh
git pull
```

Merge a different branch into your active branch:

```sh
git merge <branchname>
```

View all the merge conflicts

```sh
git diff
```
