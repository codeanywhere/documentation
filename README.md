# Codeanywhere Docs

Run it locally with

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

and then visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

The markdown files support the following HTML tags:

- `img`
- `iframe`
- `pre`
- `code`
- `div`
- `video`
- `source`

When adding new pages, the markdown file should be placed in the appropriate folder (`getting-started`/`connections`/`features`), and an additional entry should be added to the `sidebar.json` file.
