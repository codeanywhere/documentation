# Codeanywhere Docs

Run it locally with

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

and then visiting http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

The markdown files support the following HTML tags:

- `img`
- `iframe`
- `pre`
- `code`
- `div`
- `video`
- `source`

When adding new pages, the markdown file should be placed in the appropriate folder (`getting-started`/`connections`/`features`), and an additional entry should be added to the `sidebar.json` file.

## Contributing

To contribute: 

All contributions must be submitted as a [Pull Request (PR)](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) so you need to [fork this repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) on your GitHub account.

**NOTE:** Commit your changes following the [Conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specifications.
  - For example: Adding a new section called `Other` would require a commit message `feat: Added Other section` and applying a small change to the `README.md` file would require a message: `fix: Updated README to include Contribution guidelines`.
